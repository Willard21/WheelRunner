# WheelRunner
A simple Javascript game in which you control a wheel and move around on a collapsing ground.

### Controls
The arrow keys may be used to move left and right.

### Objective
There's currently no real objective. It's just fun to watch the floor break behind you.

### Plans
I intend to add currency and upgrades. Upgrades will be available for the torque and max speed of the wheel, as well as the size and density of floor particles. I'm also considering using a car (or at least 2 connected wheels) instead of just 1 wheel.

I originally started this project on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/moon-sand/4987611722055680), which is why it's all in a single file. I may move it into multiple files in the future if it gets too big, or if I decide host it somewhere other than Khan Academy.
